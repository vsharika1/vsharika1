### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a dedicated Computing Science major from Simon Fraser University with a rich blend of technical skills, hands-on work experience, and impactful projects, I bring a multifaceted approach to software development and IT solutions. My technical repertoire spans advanced proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming, full-stack development with a focus on JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, and mobile development in Swift and Java. I have a strong foundation in Python, C/C++, and data science technologies, including Keras and TensorFlow for machine learning projects.

My professional journey includes roles as a Service Desk Technician at Simon Fraser University and a Security Analyst IAM at Canadian Tire Corporation, where I honed my skills in IT support, security management, and application development. These roles enhanced my ability to deliver comprehensive customer service, troubleshoot complex technical issues, and contribute to secure, efficient digital environments.

I've applied my learning to a series of significant projects, such as developing a React-based note-taking app "Keeper," a nuisance reporting web app for community safety, and a physical activity tracker "MyRuns" for Android. Each project underscored my commitment to creating user-centric solutions, leveraging data effectively, and employing best practices in software development.

As I approach the completion of my BSc in Computing Science, I am eager to explore opportunities that challenge me to apply my skills in innovative ways, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue my growth in the field of technology.
